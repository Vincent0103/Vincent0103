# Welcome to Vincent0103's GitHub Profile! 🦊

## Who am i? 😑

Hello there! I'm Vincent, a passionate student pursuing an IT degree at the university of Orsay. For over 2 years, I dedicated myself onto learning to code, more specifically web development. Thank to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) for letting me this happen. \
Currently, I built a couple dozen of programs, most of them are web applications all available open source on my GitHub repository down there!

## My Goals ⚽

My ultimate goal is to make off a living by making a start-up in a form of a web application or even mobile application and generate money out of it, even selling websites to potential customers would make me feel successful. \
I'm going through college so I can further improve my skills into web development but most importantly, my skills into artificial intelligence, as A.I. is getting better and better at making programs, it is important for me to know how to handle this tool on my own advantage.
